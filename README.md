# 30daysReact-01

Day One // 30 days of React challenge // "Question and Answer" app
This is an uber-basic React.js app that shows a question, and then reveals the answer upon clicking.

Follow me *programming noob* as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned.

By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
